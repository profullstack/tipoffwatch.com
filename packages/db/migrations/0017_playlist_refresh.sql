-- Refreshing a channel list on a schedule.
--
-- The provider supports no conditional request at all -- measured 2026-08-21: no
-- ETag, no Last-Modified, no Content-Length, and If-Modified-Since is ignored and
-- answered with a full 200. So every poll is the whole ~800KB file and there is no
-- way to ask "has it changed" cheaply.
--
-- What CAN be avoided is the write. A hash of the body decides whether the 7,000
-- channel rows are rewritten, and most polls will hash the same -- the provider
-- rewrites its numbered event slots near kickoff and leaves the rest alone. Without
-- this, a five-minute poll is 288 delete-and-reinsert cycles a day over 7,000 rows
-- each, for a file that changed a dozen times.

-- When this list may next be fetched. Normally "now", but a provider that is down
-- or a line that has expired gets backed off rather than retried every interval --
-- there is no point pulling 800KB every five minutes from something answering 404,
-- and hammering a dead line is how the account behind it gets noticed.
