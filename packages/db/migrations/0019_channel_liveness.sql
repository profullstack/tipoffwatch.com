-- Whether a channel actually plays, rather than merely existing in a playlist.

-- A provider list is mostly aspirational. Of the entries we hand people, a large
-- share answer with an HTML error page instead of video: the slot exists, the
-- title is right, and there is nothing behind it. Offering one of those is worse
-- than offering nothing, because the reader taps it during a match and finds out
-- the hard way.
--
-- So a channel now carries the result of the last time we asked. Three states,
-- and the third is load-bearing: null means never checked, which must not be
-- confused with checked-and-dead. A never-checked channel is still offered --
-- checking all 7,000 on import is not possible against a provider that limits
-- concurrent connections -- and it is checked at the moment somebody reaches for
-- it.

-- The read is "this playlist's channels, freshest verdict first", and the verdict
-- is only meaningful for a while: a slot that was dead an hour ago may be live
-- now, because the provider rewrites its event slots around kickoff.
