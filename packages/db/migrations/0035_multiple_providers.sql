-- More than one line per reader.

-- 0015 wrote "One list per account. A second add replaces the first rather than
-- accumulating credentials nobody remembers giving us", and enforced it with a
-- UNIQUE on user_id. That was the right instinct about credentials and the wrong
-- shape for the product: a reader with two subscriptions could only ever tell us
-- about one, and the second was silently destroyed by adding it.
--
-- It also forced an awkward mechanism on the paid line. A managed pass could not
-- sit alongside a reader's own list, so it had to STASH their source url, take the
-- row for itself, and hand it back when the pass lapsed (see 0033). With several
-- rows allowed the stash has nothing left to do: our line is simply one provider
-- among the reader's, and a lapse removes that row and disturbs nothing else.
--
-- The credentials concern from 0015 does not go away, it just moves. A cap lives
-- in the handler rather than the schema, because "too many" is a product question
-- that should not need a migration to answer, and every list is still sealed and
-- still never rendered.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------- the constraint -- */

-- Named implicitly by 0015 (`user_id uuid not null unique`), so Postgres called it
-- user_playlists_user_id_key. Dropped by that name, guarded so a database built
-- after this migration -- or one where it was already removed -- still applies.

-- Where a list sits in the reader's own ordering, which is also the tie-break when
-- two providers both carry a game. Defaulted rather than backfilled per row: every
-- existing account has exactly one list, so they are all position 0 and correct.
--
-- Added BEFORE the index below, which sorts on it. A migration that creates the
-- index first fails outright on a fresh database, and only there -- on an existing
-- one every statement is guarded and the file appears to apply cleanly.

-- What replaces the constraint. Not a uniqueness rule: source_url is sealed with a
-- random nonce per write, so the same provider url encrypts to different bytes
-- every time and a UNIQUE on it would never fire. This is only the lookup the new
-- queries make constantly: "every list this reader has, in their order".

/* -------------------------------------------------------------- the stash --- */

-- Give back anything the stash is currently holding, as a row of its own.
--
-- Order matters here and it is the only destructive step in this file. A reader
-- part-way through a live pass has their own list sitting in stashed_source_url
-- with our managed line in source_url. Dropping the columns first would delete a
-- provider subscription they gave us and expect back, so the stash is materialised
-- into a real row BEFORE the columns go.
--
-- The label is carried across where there was one. `position` puts the returned
-- list after the managed line rather than in front of it: the reader is currently
-- paying us for the managed one, so it stays first until they say otherwise.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- channels -- */

-- Nothing here needs changing, which is worth saying rather than leaving implied.
-- A channel already belongs to a PLAYLIST rather than to a user, so the fan-out is
-- a wider IN list against an index 0015 already created
-- (user_playlist_channels_playlist_idx) rather than a new access path.
