 * plausible garbage. The nonce is random per value and stored alongside; reusing a
 * nonce under one key is the mistake that breaks GCM outright, so it is never
 * derived from the plaintext or a counter.
 *
 * This is encryption at rest, not a password scheme. It protects against a database
 * dump, a log line and a backup -- not against someone who already has the running
 * process's environment, who by definition has the key too.
