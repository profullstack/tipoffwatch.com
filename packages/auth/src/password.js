/**
 * An optional password, and the reasoning for allowing one at all.
 *
 * The rest of this package is magic link and passkey, and the argument against a
 * password is still true: it is a weaker second secret whose recovery path collapses
 * back to emailing a link, so it widens the attack surface without widening what an
 * attacker has to defeat.
 *
 * It exists anyway because there is a device where the other two do not work. A
 * television has no mail client to open a link in, no authenticator to hold a
 * passkey, and a remote control instead of a keyboard. "Sign in on another device"
 * is not an answer when the TV IS the device. A credential you can type is the only
 * kind that works there.
 *
 * So the shape is: opt-in, never required, never created for you, and removable.
 * An account has a password only if somebody deliberately set one while already
 * signed in by a stronger method, which means this can never be the way an account
 * is first taken over -- an attacker who could set a password here already had the
 * session needed to do anything else.

/**
 * Check an address and password, and start a session if they match.
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing here.
 *
 * One: every failure returns the same thing. Not "no such account", not "that
 * account has no password" -- those answer a question the caller has no business
 * asking, and turn the login form into an address checker.
 *
 * Two: the work done is the same either way. A missing account still verifies
 * against a decoy hash, so the two cases cannot be told apart by how long the answer
 * takes.
 *
 * Three: it is rate limited, and the limit is not a lockout. When somebody is made
 * to wait, the message points at the emailed link -- which still works, is not
 * guessable, and is not affected by this counter. So flooding an address with wrong
 * guesses cannot lock its owner out of their own account; it can only take away the
 * convenience of the password.
 *
 * `db` defaults to the real queries and exists so the properties above can be tested
 * without a database. Module-level mocking cannot do it: importing this file binds
 * the queries module, so whichever test file imports it first decides what every
 * later one gets, and a mock registered afterwards silently does nothing. That
 * failure is invisible -- the mock appears to work when the file runs alone and only
 * breaks in the full suite -- so the seam is explicit instead.
