 * The stored URL is sealed because it carries the reader's provider username and
 * password in its path, and for a long time that was read as "it can never be
 * shown" -- so settings offered a label, a count, Refresh and Remove, and nothing
 * else. That is not privacy, it is amnesia: the only way to change a list was to
 * delete it and type the whole credentialed URL again, which meant keeping a copy
 * of it somewhere less safe than here.
 *
 * The credential belongs to the account that supplied it, so showing it back to
 * that same account, behind that same session, discloses nothing it did not
 * already have. What is kept is the discipline around it: masked by default,
 * revealed only on a deliberate request, and never written into a cached page.
