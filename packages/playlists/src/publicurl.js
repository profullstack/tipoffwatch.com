/**
 * The guard that makes proxying a THIRD-PARTY url safe.
 *
 * Every other stream this app opens is a url the reader themselves supplied:
 * their own provider line, or one shared with them by its owner. Proxying that
 * grants nobody anything they did not already have, so `openStream` fetches it
 * without asking where it points.
 *
 * A public news channel is different in exactly one way that matters: the url
 * comes from iptv-org, by way of nichedb, and nobody in that chain is us. An
 * attacker who lands a url in that directory would otherwise have our server
 * fetch it from INSIDE the deployment -- and this deployment has a private
 * network with Postgres and Redis on it, reachable at names like
 * `postgres.railway.internal` that resolve to addresses no reader can reach.
 * That is server-side request forgery, and the fix is to refuse before
 * connecting rather than to hope the directory stays clean.
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Resolve the name, then judge the ADDRESS.** A hostname allowlist is not a
 *    defence: `internal.evil.com` is a perfectly ordinary public name with an A
 *    record pointing at 10.0.0.5.
 * 2. **Never follow a redirect blindly.** A public url may 302 to a private one,
 *    which is the same attack with an extra step, so `fetchPublic` walks the
 *    hops itself and re-checks each.
