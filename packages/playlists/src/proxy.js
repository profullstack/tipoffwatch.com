/**
 * Putting a stream in front of a browser, which cannot fetch it itself.
 *
 * Everything else in this feature deliberately keeps tipoffwatch out of the path
 * of the video: the reader's own URL goes back to the reader's own player and no
 * bytes cross this server. That is still the better route wherever it works, and
 * it is still what the VLC, Infuse and .m3u buttons do.
 *
 * It cannot work in a browser, and not for one reason but four, each of which is
 * on its own fatal:
 *
 *   - The provider serves `http://`. A page on https may not load an http media
 *     source, and no header relaxes that -- mixed content is not a CSP decision,
 *     so there is nothing to loosen.
 *   - It sends no CORS headers, so even an https provider would be unreadable by
 *     a script on our origin.
 *   - The URL is the reader's subscription credential. In an href it is already
 *     exposed to whoever is holding the phone, which is acceptable because that
 *     is the account's own owner; handed to a page it would also sit in history,
 *     in the referrer of anything the page loads next, and in reach of any
 *     extension reading the DOM.
 *   - Some lines answer only a player-shaped user agent, and a browser cannot
 *     forge one.
 *
 * So for the browser -- and only for the browser -- the bytes come through here.
 * What arrives is MPEG-2 Transport Stream, which no browser can decode natively
 * either; the page transmuxes it to fMP4 and feeds Media Source Extensions. That
 * transmux is deliberately the CLIENT's job: this stays a byte pipe with no
 * ffmpeg, no segmenting and no per-viewer CPU, which is the difference between a
 * feature that runs on the container already deployed and one that needs a fleet.
 *
 * One reader, one upstream connection, and it belongs to the account that
 * supplied it. This is not a restream: nothing here is shared between accounts,
 * cached, or reachable without the session of the person whose subscription it
 * is.

/**
 * How many streams one account may have open at once, and what happens at the
 * ceiling: the OLDEST one is dropped, not the newest.
 *
 * The ceiling itself is not a rate limit and not about our capacity. A provider
 * line permits a small number of simultaneous connections -- often exactly one --
 * and exceeding it is what gets a subscription suspended. The reader owns that
 * line, so the ceiling protects THEM.
 *
 * Refusing the new stream also respected the ceiling, and was wrong anyway.
 * Pressing Play on a second channel is not an accident to be corrected: it says
 * which channel is wanted now. "You are already watching a channel" told the
 * reader to go and stop something they had usually already stopped -- because the
 * page tears the old player down before it asks for the new one, and the server
 * only learns that when the abort of a socket it is no longer reading reaches it.
 * That is a race the reader cannot see and cannot win by trying again quickly:
 * pressing Play twice in a second was the reliable way to be told no.
 *
 * So the newest claim evicts the oldest, and eviction is not just bookkeeping --
 * `evict` aborts the upstream fetch, so the provider connection is really gone
 * before the replacement is opened. One line, one connection, and the reader
 * never has to think about it.
 *
 * In process, not in Redis, because there is one web container. Splitting the web
 * role across instances makes this per-instance and therefore too generous; that
 * is the moment to move the registry, and the reason it is a small module of its
