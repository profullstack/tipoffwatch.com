/**
 * Does this channel actually play?
 *
 * A provider playlist is mostly aspirational. The slot exists and the title is
 * right, and a large share of them answer with an HTML error page rather than
 * video -- measured against a real line: several endpoints returned
 * `text/html; charset=UTF-8` with zero bytes where a stream was advertised.
 * Handing one of those to somebody during a match is worse than handing them
 * nothing, because they find out by tapping it.
 *
 * The check is deliberately small: ask for the first couple of kilobytes and look
 * at what comes back. That is enough to tell video from an error page, costs no
 * meaningful bandwidth, and holds the upstream connection for under a second --
 * which matters, because these lines cap concurrent connections and a probe that
 * lingers is a probe that competes with the reader's own playback.
 */

/**
 * What a working stream looks like coming back.
 *
 * Exported because the browser proxy has to make the same judgement from the same
 * headers, and two lists that drift apart would mean a channel the probe calls
 * live and the player calls broken.
