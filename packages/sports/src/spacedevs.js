/**
 * Spaceflight, from TheSpaceDevs Launch Library 2.
 *
 * Structurally the closest thing here to a sports fixture: a named event, at a
 * place, at a time, with a countdown people genuinely set alarms for. It is also
 * the only category whose provider tells us how much to trust the clock --
 * `net_precision` says "Second" or "Month" outright, which is the field the rest
 * of this site had to infer.
 *
 * The hard constraint is the rate limit: FIFTEEN requests per hour without a key,
 * shared across the whole deployment. That is the entire budget, so this adapter
 * takes one page of 100 and stops by default, and the sync scheduler runs it
 * hourly rather than alongside everything else. Blowing the budget here does not
 * degrade gracefully -- the next call returns 429 for the rest of the hour.
