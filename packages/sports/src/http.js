/**
 * One fetch path for every provider, because every provider throttles differently.
 *
 * The sibling sports site could get away with a bare `fetch`: it talked to one
 * upstream that tolerated a few hundred requests an hour. This site talks to five,
 * and their limits differ by three orders of magnitude -- TMDB is happy at 50
 * requests a second, MusicBrainz cuts you off above one, and TheSpaceDevs allows
 * fifteen an HOUR without a key. A single shared concurrency setting cannot be
 * right for all of them, so the limit lives next to the adapter that needs it and
 * this module enforces it per host.
 *
 * The queue is per host rather than per adapter so that two adapters hitting the
 * same API (TVmaze for shows and for episodes) share one budget rather than
 * doubling it.
