/**
 * Live TV passes: selling a line of our own.
 *
 * The bring-your-own rail plays a list the reader already pays somebody else
 * for. This is the other rail: a pass buys time on a line we hold with a
 * reseller account, and the line is dropped into `user_playlists` as a MANAGED
 * list -- so the event page, the probes, Play, Multiview and the connection cap
 * all work on it unchanged. What differs is what a managed list withholds: the
 * address is never revealed, nothing is handed to VLC or a .m3u, and it cannot
 * be shared. Each of those would hand our reseller credential to somebody who
 * did not pay for it.
 *
 * Two clocks, deliberately separate. The PASS is what we sold and is what gates
 * access; the LINE is what the provider issued and outlives a weekly pass by
 * three weeks because the provider sells nothing shorter than a month. When the
 * pass lapses the managed list is taken down and the line is left alone -- the
 * reader who buys again gets the same line back, extended, rather than a second
 * one on our balance.
 *
 * Provisioning is explicit, never a background guess. It runs after a settled
 * payment and when the reader presses "set up my channels"; the scheduled tick
 * only ever takes lapsed lists DOWN. The alternative -- a tick that provisions
 * whenever a pass holder has no managed list -- fights a reader who chose to use
 * their own list while their pass runs, replacing it every fifteen minutes.
