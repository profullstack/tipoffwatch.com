# tipoffwatch.com

Sports calendar and reminder PWA. Follow any team in the world; get a web
notification and an email an hour before kickoff, and again one minute out.
Free for users.

## Stack

One Bun process, one Railway service, two managed datastores.

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Bun 1.3 | Web and workers share one runtime, so one container runs both |
| Web | Hono + `hono/jsx` SSR | Server-rendered; every control is a plain form and works with JS off |
| Data | Postgres | Write-heavy at viral scale: follows, fan-out claims, delivery receipts |
| Queue | BullMQ on Redis | Reminder fan-out, fixture sync, retries and backoff |
| Auth | Magic link + passkey | No passwords, so nothing to reset, rotate or leak |
| Fixtures | ESPN public JSON | 354 leagues / 17 sports, free and keyless |

## Running locally

```sh
cp .env.example .env      # fill in what you need; nothing is required to boot
docker compose up         # app + postgres + redis
bun run sync              # seed the catalogue and the first fortnight of fixtures
```

Without Docker, point `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` at any Postgres and Redis
and run `bun run dev`.

## Layout

```
apps/web        Hono server, JSX views, PWA assets. Also boots the workers.
apps/worker     Same workers, standalone, for when one instance stops being enough.
packages/config Reads the environment. Nothing else touches process.env.
packages/db     Schema, forward-only migrations, and every query the app runs.
packages/sports Provider adapters. ESPN today; the interface takes others.
packages/queue  BullMQ queues, schedules and the fan-out workers.
packages/notify Web push (VAPID) and email (Resend).
packages/auth   Magic link, passkeys, sessions.
packages/payments CoinPay checkout, webhook verification, entitlements.
packages/playlists A reader's own M3U line: import, probe, proxy, share.
packages/radio  A reader's own SiriusXM: email+code sign-in, lineups, HLS proxy.
```

## How reminders scale

This is the part built for going viral, so it is worth stating plainly.

A naive implementation enqueues one job per follower when a game approaches. A
World Cup final with two million followers would enqueue two million jobs at
once and the queue becomes the outage.

Instead there are three tiers:

1. **Scan** (every 30s) finds events crossing a reminder threshold and enqueues
   one job per `(event, offset)` — job id `fo:<event>:<offset>`, so a scan that
   runs twice produces the same job rather than a second fan-out.
2. **Fan-out** pages that event's followers with a keyset cursor on `user_id`
   and enqueues one job per *page* of 500. Two million followers become four
   thousand jobs, and paging cost stays flat instead of degrading with `OFFSET`.
3. **Batch** claims and sends. The claim is an insert into `reminder_deliveries`
   whose primary key is `(event, user, offset, channel)`; a retried or duplicated
   job gets an empty set back and sends nothing.

Claiming happens **before** sending, so the worst case is a dropped notification
rather than a duplicate one — the right way round for something that buzzes a
phone at midnight. Reminders more than `REMINDER_MAX_LATENESS_SECONDS` past due
are dropped rather than delivered late.

## Fixture ingestion

ESPN publishes an unauthenticated JSON API. It is undocumented and carries no
SLA, which is exactly why every response is normalised and persisted immediately:
the calendar serves from our own tables, so an upstream outage degrades freshness
instead of blanking the site.

A whole date range comes back in one request, so a 14-day horizon costs one call
per league — a full sweep of 354 leagues is ~354 requests. That is why this runs
free where a live-scores vendor would charge $129/mo: schedules are cheap, live
scores are what you pay for.

Responses cap at ~100 events, so `fetchSchedule` splits the window and re-fetches
when it hits the cap — a truncated response is otherwise indistinguishable from a
quiet fortnight and would silently drop half a busy league's season.

## Deploying

One Railway service from the Dockerfile, plus managed Postgres and Redis.
`ROLES` decides what an instance runs (`web`, `worker`, or both — the default).
Migrations apply themselves on boot behind an advisory lock, so a deploy needs no
manual step.

Never hardcode a port: Railway injects `PORT`, and a fixed `-p` leaves the edge
proxy forwarding to a closed socket while the container reports healthy.

Secrets belong on the service and in the logicsrc vault, not in a committed
`.env`.

## Radio (SiriusXM)

A reader connects their own SiriusXM subscription in settings — email and
password, or the code SiriusXM emails them, the two doors the SiriusXM app
itself offers; only the resulting session is kept — and the sports and news lineups play on `/radio` and on a fixture's page. The
session is sealed with the playlist key and every byte is fetched by the server
as that reader; the browser never sees a SiriusXM address or a bearer. The player
is `@profullstack/player` with its audio bar, bundled to `vendor-player.js` and
fetched on the first press of Play.

For the leagues SiriusXM carries by team (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA, the college
football and basketball conferences, MLS), a fixture's page and a team's page
draw an **On SiriusXM** section that looks up each side's own feed as soon as
the page is up: the team name is parsed (`packages/radio/src/teams.js`),
SiriusXM is searched for it on the reader's session, and only channels that
actually name the team are kept. Lookups are cached across readers for ten
minutes, so a busy fixture costs one search per side, not one per view. Team
feeds appear close to kickoff and vanish after; the section says which.

Knobs, all read at request time:

- `SIRIUSXM` — `0` turns the rail off. Defaults to on for the tipoffwatch brand
  and off for any other `BRAND`.
- `SIRIUSXM_PROXY_URL` — the residential exit for every SiriusXM call. Falls back
  to `SPORTS_PROXY_URL`. Not optional in production: SiriusXM answers a
  datacenter address with 403 and pins a session to the IP that authenticated it.
- `SIRIUSXM_PROXIES` — a pool of single-IP proxies (`host:port:user:pass` lines
  or full URLs, comma or newline separated). Each reader is hashed to one and
  keeps it, so login, refresh and playback all leave through the same address.
  Set this when a rotating endpoint starts breaking streams mid-segment.
- `SIRIUSXM_DEVICE_GRANT` — a `DEVICE_GRANT` cookie value pasted from a browser
  session, for the rare case SiriusXM refuses to start a sign-in without one.
  The sign-in is tried without it first.

The pending-code state between "send code" and "verify" lives in the web
process's memory for ten minutes, which is right for one web replica and would
need Redis for more.
