# Copy the whole deps stage, not just /app/node_modules. Bun's isolated linker puts
# each workspace's dependencies in ITS OWN node_modules (apps/web/node_modules,
# packages/*/node_modules) rather than hoisting them to the root, so copying only
# the root directory leaves every workspace import unresolvable at build time.
# Listing the nested directories individually is not an option either: a package
# with no dependencies has no node_modules at all and the COPY would fail.
