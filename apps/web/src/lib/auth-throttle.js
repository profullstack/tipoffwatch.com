/**
 * Escalating per-caller backoff in front of the unauthenticated auth routes.
 *
 * ## What was already here, and what it did not cover
 *
 * `packages/auth/src/password.js` counts failures per ADDRESS: ten wrong guesses
 * in fifteen minutes and that address is made to wait. That is the right defence
 * for one account under attack, and it stays exactly as it is.
 *
 * It does nothing about the other shape, which is the one actually arriving: one
 * caller working through a list of many different addresses. Every address is on
 * its own counter, so none of them ever trips, and each request still reaches
 * `Bun.password.verify` — argon2id, memory-hard, deliberately expensive. A list
 * of ten thousand addresses is therefore ten thousand free argon2 hashes, which
 * is both an unmetered credential-stuffing run and a way to burn the box's CPU
 * from outside. This refuses *before* the hash, which is the point.
 *
 * ## Keying on the address, which the old comment says not to do
 *
 * `app.js` says the forwarded address is "never used as the rate-limit key -- a
 * shared address would then throttle strangers", and that was correct about the
 * per-account counter it was describing: keying an account lockout on an IP lets
 * one person behind a NAT lock out everybody else behind it.
 *
 * This is a different thing and the trade lands the other way. It is not a
 * lockout — an emailed sign-in link is unaffected by this counter, so a throttled
 * caller always has a way in that is not guessable — and without an address key
 * there is nothing at all metering a spray across many accounts. So: strangers
 * behind one NAT can slow each other's *password form* down, and they can still
 * sign in the ordinary way while it lasts.
 *
 * ## Why escalating rather than a fixed window
 *
 * A fixed window is waited out. Fifteen minutes of quiet and the attacker starts
 * again at full rate, for ever, which is what is happening now. Doubling the
 * penalty each time prices out persistence — a minute, then two, then an hour,
 * then a day — while somebody who fat-fingered a password five times is forgiven
 * in a minute and forgiven entirely the moment they sign in.
 *
 * ## Why in this process's memory
 *
 * Because the endpoint being defended is the one that must not grow a database
 * round trip: a limiter that needs Postgres to tell an attacker "no" hands the
 * attacker the load it was built to prevent. One web instance sees every request
 * today. A deploy forgives everyone, which is the right direction to err on a
 * public sign-in page.
 */

/**
 * Two curves, because the two things being defended are not alike.
 *
 * `AUTH` guards the endpoints that try a credential. Eight attempts is more than
 * anybody types by accident, and a caller that keeps going deserves the day-long
 * ceiling.
 *
 * `VIEW` guards GET /login, which is a page a real person looks at. The shape is
 * the same -- doubling, so a crawler at one a second is priced out within a
 * minute -- but the allowance is far wider and the ceiling is an hour rather than
 * a day. That matters because this is the one lock that can catch somebody with
 * nothing to prove: an office or a mobile carrier behind one address shares this
 * counter, and a person who cannot reach the sign-in page has no way around it.
 * Thirty views before any penalty, and an hour is the worst a false positive can
 * cost.
 *
 * In both, DECAY must exceed MAX_LOCK. If it does not, a caller that waits out
 * the longest lock comes back to find its strikes already decayed, the penalty
 * can never grow past that point, and the escalation quietly flattens into the
 * fixed window this was built instead of. `the penalty keeps escalating` covers
 * it; keep that test.
