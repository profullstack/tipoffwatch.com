      get told an hour before kickoff, and again a minute out — by web notification, email, or both.

    <h2>Where the data comes from</h2>
    <p>
      Schedules, teams and scores come from <strong>ESPN's public JSON API</strong> (
      <code>site.api.espn.com</code> and <code>sports.core.api.espn.com</code>). We are not
      affiliated with ESPN.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Every response is normalised and stored here, so the calendar keeps working when the upstream
      is slow or unavailable — it goes stale rather than blank. Fixtures refresh every few hours and
      the league catalogue daily.
    </p>

    <h2>Times</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      All times are stored in UTC and shown in your browser's own time zone (
      <span data-tz-label>your device</span>). Emailed reminders use the zone set in{' '}
      <a href="/settings">settings</a>, since an email has no browser to ask.
    </p>

    <h2>Is it really free?</h2>
    <p>
      Following teams, the calendar and the reminders are free and stay free. The only thing anyone
      pays for is a live stream, when someone is sharing one.
    </p>

    <h2>Open data</h2>
    <p>

      what you need.
