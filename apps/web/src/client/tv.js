/**
 * Is this a television?
 *
 * Asked for one reason: a Fire TV stick and a laptop want opposite things from
 * the same live stream, and the player has been tuned for the laptop.
 *
 * On a desktop the connection is fast and steady, so reading ahead is wasted
 * latency and chasing the live edge keeps a match from drifting minutes behind.
 * On a stick behind household wifi, decoding a transport stream on a CPU an order
 * of magnitude slower, both of those choices are actively harmful: with no
 * read-ahead buffer every jitter spike is a stall, and latency chasing answers a
 * stall by seeking forward, which is a stall the reader can see. The stream stops
 * and starts until it is abandoned, which is what "it does not play on Silk"
 * looks like from the sofa.
 *
 * So the buffering profile is picked per screen. There is no feature to detect
 * here -- the difference is the device, not the API surface -- so this is a user
 * agent test, which is exactly the kind of thing that ages badly and is therefore
 * kept to one list in one file with a test beside it.
 *
 * The patterns are the same set media-streamer uses, and deliberately so: these
 * two players face the same devices and a device that is a television in one and
 * a desktop in the other is a bug waiting in whichever was not looked at.
