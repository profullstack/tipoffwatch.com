 *
 * Loaded on DEMAND, though, and that is the difference from vendor-webauthn.js.
 * This library is a few hundred kilobytes -- it contains a full MPEG-2 transport
 * stream demuxer -- and almost nobody on an event page is about to press play.
 * app.js injects the tag when the button is actually used, so the page weight is
 * paid by the reader who wanted it.
 *
 * What it does: a browser has no TS demuxer for <video> and never will, so the
 * bytes are demuxed here, remuxed into fragmented MP4 and pushed into Media Source
 * Extensions. That is why this runs on the client rather than the server -- the
 * alternative is ffmpeg per viewer, which is a fleet rather than a feature.
