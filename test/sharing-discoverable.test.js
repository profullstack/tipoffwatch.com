 * "I'm not seeing it in settings, the option to share."
 *
 * Reported twice, and both times the code was already there: every piece of
 * playlist sharing is present on this site -- setPlaylistShared, /shared,
 * sharedChannelsFor, the proxy play route, the whole thing. What was missing was
 * any way to find out it existed.
 *
 * The switch rendered only for an account that already had a channel list. It was
 * reported against the sibling brand, where no account had one at all, and the
 * same gap was here: the paragraph
 * directly above it promised the list "stays private to your account unless you
 * choose otherwise below" and pointed at nothing at all.
 *
 * A feature that appears only once you have already done the prerequisite cannot
 * be discovered by anybody who has not, which is indistinguishable from it not
 * being built.
