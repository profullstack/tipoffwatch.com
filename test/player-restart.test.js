/**
 * Rebuilding the player instead of giving up on it.
 *
 * The reported symptom was "That stream could not be played here (MediaMSEError).
 * Try VLC." on a channel that was streaming perfectly well, and the cause is not
 * in this repo: mpegts.js configures one source buffer per track from the first
 * init segment and has no `changeType()` call anywhere in it. A live transport
 * stream is under no obligation to keep the same shape -- an ad break or a
 * regional opt-out changes the audio configuration -- so the library eventually
 * appends an init segment its own source buffer will not take, Media Source
 * Extensions throws, and the player is dead with the stream still fine.
 *
 * A new player built at that moment starts from the stream's current shape and
 * works. So the error is a reason to reconnect, not a reason to stop, and this
 * file is about which errors are which -- because reconnecting to the wrong one
 * means three more connections on a line that suspends accounts for concurrency.
 *
 * Both clocks are driven by hand. Real timers would make a test of a backoff
 * schedule take eleven seconds and still be flaky.
