/**
 * Storing a list that does not fit in memory.
 *
 * Reported as "that list is 583MB, which is larger than we store". The ceiling
 * that produced it had been raised twice before -- 8MB, then 100MB -- and each
 * raise was wrong within months, because the number was never really about bytes.
 * The import held every parsed entry until it knew whether it wanted them, and
 * 583MB of provider catalogue is roughly 2.6 million entries: raising the ceiling
 * alone would have swapped a clear refusal for an out-of-memory kill.
 *
 * So the claim under test is not "big lists are allowed" but "nothing here scales
 * with the size of the list". These run a few thousand entries rather than a few
 * million, so what they measure is the SHAPE -- what is resident at once, and
 * whether it grows with the input -- which is the part that has to hold at 583MB.
