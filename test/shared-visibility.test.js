/**
 * "Another user follows me but they are not seeing my streams."
 *
 * Two separate things, and only one of them was a bug.
 *
 * FOLLOWING IS NOT SHARING. Visibility is gated on `user_playlists.shared` alone;
 * no query in this codebase joins a follow to a channel. A follower of somebody
 * who has not opened their list sees nothing, correctly.
 *
 * The bug: once a list IS shared, the viewer's read took the first 20,000 rows by
 * position and ranked those, while the OWNER's own page narrowed in SQL across the
 * whole list. On a 300,000-entry VOD catalogue the row that carries a fixture is
 * usually past 20,000 -- so the owner saw it and everybody they shared with did
 * not, which reads exactly like sharing being broken.
