/**
 * Every queue that has a worker must also have something that enqueues to it.
 *
 * This exists because the playlist refresh silently never ran. The queue was
 * declared, the worker was registered and consuming, and the one line in
 * installSchedules that actually creates the repeatable was lost in a rebase.
 *
 * Nothing failed. A consumer with no producer does not error, it waits -- so the
 * logs were empty, the app was healthy, and the feature was simply absent. That
 * is the shape of bug worth a test: not a wrong answer, a missing one.
