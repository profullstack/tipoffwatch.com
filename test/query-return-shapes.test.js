/**
 * A query that projects a row must hand back the row.
 *
 * This exists because of a specific self-inflicted outage. Fixing the magic-link
 * bug meant changing ONE function from `return row ?? null` to
 * `return row?.email ?? null`. Verifying that the new test failed without the fix
 * was done with `sed`, and the sed to put it back matched every occurrence in the
 * file: sixteen unrelated functions were rewritten to return an email column that
 * most of their tables do not even have.
 *
 * It happened on the sibling brand, where getSubjectBySlug then returned null for
 * every title in a 318,280-row catalogue and every film and show 404'd. The full
 * suite stayed green through all of it, which is why this guard is here rather
 * than only there.
 *
 * So the check is structural, on the source, because that is the shape the
 * mistake had: a mechanical edit that is individually plausible everywhere it
 * landed and wrong in all but one place.
